## Introduction
Violent crimes are one of the world's most severe social issues, posing a threat to peace and security. Also, many people feel anxious and terrified by it. The goal of this project is to predict the perpetrator's relationship with the victim in order to identify a pattern that may be used to control and limit these crimes, by using Classification as a part of machine learning.

## Data Description
We choose [Homicide dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports) which contains murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 to 2014. This dataset contains 638454 rows and 24 columns, our features are 
**age** , **race**, **gender**, **ethnicity of victims and perpetrators**, and **weapon used** ..etc. And our target is **relationship between the victim and perpetrator**.

## Tools
